## How to Use This App

From the main scren, go to the section titled "Filter Results".
Choose the neighborhood you are interested in researching.
Choose the cuisine you are interested in eating.
The map will be re-focused on your chosen neighborhood with the available restaurants shown as blue "pins".
Those restaurants will also be listed below the map -- a photo, the address, and a button to click to view more details will be displayed.

Clicking on the "View Details" button will display a photograph, the hours of operation, and customer reviews of that restaurant.

Choose a restaurant to dine at, follow the map for direction, and enjoy your meal!
